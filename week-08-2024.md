Week 08, 2024

Bit of a strange week. Some unexpected events meant that I had a bit more time to work on hobby projects.

---

Did some coding and writing to get an MVP of this blog live. Finally! At some point I'll do a write-up about the rabbit holes I went down, the choices I made, and why.

## Planning

-   campervan trip to Glenariff at the end of the month
-   job search
-   getting my workshop ready for the next project

## Links to stuff that interested me

-   [Get Organised with Zavala](https://zavala.vincode.io)

- [Netlify sent this person a $104K bill for hosting a simple static site](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1b14bty/netlify_just_sent_me_a_104k_bill_for_a_simple/). Eek. DDOS attack on a music file in a static site hosted on Netlify's "free" tier. Glad I'm using Cloudflare's actual free tier. Won't ever host on Netlify now, and have since deleted all my prototype sites from there, and deleted my user account.
